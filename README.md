# Document Filters

Hylandâ€™s Document Filters SDK gives software developers the tools they need to embed rich document processing into their applications. Document Filters is the ideal toolkit to enable file inspection and processing. 

**Deeply inspect content and data**
Identify and extract every document, email, archive and container format while analyzing all text and data associated with your content.

**Render and annotate content**
Seamlessly manipulate and render high-definition content in a web-safe format with tools to apply precise redaction marks, annotations and more.

**Transform and output content**
Export content and easily convert it for use in other locations. Replicate original files and combine pages from different documents to create packets.

**Leverage the most advanced document filtering platform**
Deploy seamlessly across 31 software platforms and architectures, and work with nearly any programming language to identify more than 600 file formats.

In this repository, you'll find the shared libraries and DLLs for releases published since version 23.2. If you're searching for the SDK installers that include samples and documentation, kindly obtain them from the Hyland Community website.
