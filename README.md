# Document Filters

Hylandâ€™s Document Filters SDK gives software developers the tools they need to embed rich document processing into their applications. A single toolkit provides all you need to:

Extract content, including track changes and hidden content from 550+ formats
Convert documents to high-fidelity renditions in PDF, SVG, HTML5, XML, PostScript or Image
Manipulate, annotate, redact and markup content, all out of the box
Document Filters is one of the few SDKs to run natively on 22 platforms, from mobile to mainframe, Android to AIX. Our APIs give you the choice of language to integrate with your application, including Java, C#, C/C++ or Python.

This repo contains samples in different languages which can be used as a reference. 

You will need either an evaluation copy, or full copy of the Document Filters which can be requested from [Hyland Software](http://www.documentfilters.com). The Document Filters package also contains these samples and is ready to run out-of-the-box.
