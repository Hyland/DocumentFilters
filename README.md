Hylandâ€™s Document Filters SDK equips software developers with powerful tools to embed rich document processing capabilities into their applications. It is ideal for enabling file inspection, data extraction, content manipulation, and document conversion across a wide array of document types and programming languages.

## Key Features

- **Deep Content Inspection**: Identify and extract data from documents, emails, archives, and container formats, analyzing all associated text and metadata.
- **Rendering and Annotation**: Render high-definition content in a web-safe format with tools for redaction, annotations, and more.
- **Content Transformation**: Export and convert content for use in other locations, replicate original files, and combine pages from different documents to create packets.
- **Advanced Filtering Platform**: Deploy across 31 software platforms and architectures, supporting nearly any programming language and over 600 file formats.

## Applications

Document Filters can be applied to:

- Enhancing AI/ML models by structuring unstructured data
- Content indexing
- E-discovery
- Data migration
