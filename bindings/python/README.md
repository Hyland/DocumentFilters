# Python Bindings for Hyland Document Filters SDK

This directory contains the Python bindings for the Hyland Document Filters SDK.
These bindings provide a Pythonic interface to utilize the SDK's functionalities
in Python applications.

## Prerequisites

To use the Python bindings, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or later)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python package installer)

## Installation

You can install the Python bindings in two ways:

### 1. Install Directly from the Directory

Navigate to the `bindings/python` directory and run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```

### 2. Add to `requirements.txt`

If you're using a requirements.txt file for your project, you can add the following line to include the Python bindings:

```text

Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
