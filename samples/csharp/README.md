## Getting Started

You can run the sample applications without a license key, with some
limitations.  See [Document Filters Evaluation](../../EVAL.md) for details.

To run the sample applications without feature limitations, ensure you have a
valid Document Filters license key. You can provide this key by either modifying
the DocumentFiltersLicense.cs file or setting it in an environment variable
named `DF_LICENSE_KEY`.

The .NET projects are compatible with win-x64, win-x64, linux-x64,
linux-musl-x64, osx-x64, and osx-arm64.

The samples are configured to pull Document Filters from NuGet. This is
configured in the `DfSamplesCommon` projects.

To compile all samples from the command line, execute:

```bash
cd samples/csharp
dotnet build 
```

Each sample is compiled into its own directory, with binaries generated in
`${PROJECT}/bin/${CONFIGURATION}/net6.0`.

To build all the samples and copy them to a single directory, run:

```bash
dotnet publish -o bin
```

Alternatively, you can open the sln in Visual Studio or the folder in VS Code.
